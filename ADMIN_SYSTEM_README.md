- **Users Management**: View and manage all users
- **Products Management**: View and manage all products
- **Orders Management**: View and manage all orders

### 4. Routes Structure

All admin routes are prefixed with `/admin` and have the name prefix `admin.`:

```php
/admin/login          - Admin login page

/admin/users          - Users management
/admin/products       - Products management
